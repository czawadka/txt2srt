Command line Java program which converts subtitles from .txt format (time-based, mpl2, mdvd) to .srt ([SubRip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip#SubRip_text_file_format)) format. If needed it uses [MediaInfo](http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en) CLI executable to automatically find out frame rate for given movie. Able to convert many subtitles at once. See InstallationAndUsage to find out how you can use it.

Latest changes are described in [ChangeLog](http://txt2srt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/java/ChangeLog) file.

Version 1.0.7 was a total mess, shame on me. Please download [1.0.8](http://txt2srt.googlecode.com/files/txt2srt-1.0.8.jar).
